Today I am starting the a new project-- Scoot Website with 4 pages. My overall goal is to work on this project in a timely manner. I am thinking of using Bootstrap for this site in addition to Sass. I changed my mind. I got frustrated that the offcanvas menu didn't work in Bootstrap, so I went back to Vanilla JS. I also looked up mor info about the best breakpoints to use. It said you should choose the breakpoint based on your design. Think about if your design changes from one column to two columns based on your device size. So, I was able to add all of the structure to the four html pages. I started some styling.

Hi. Happy Sunday! Did some work on styling my header.

### 03/21/2022

Happy Monday! I realized that I had a perfect page to refer to for making the sidebar-- My portfolio page. I also found an article about using floating elements to help with the extra designs for this page. I got my sidebar to work. It opens, but now it isn't closing. Will try to work that out tomorrow.

### 03/22/2022

Hi, I'm back. I will be home for awhile, so that means more coding time for me. Today I want to figure out this issue with the close button.

### 03/22/2022

Hi. I'm reviewing my code to see if I could clean it up and organize it. I need to make it more structured and organized. I renamed the classes to make them more usable across the pages. I added more layout scss files based on my restructuring. One I set up was the container. Hernandez set up generic styles for the container (wrapper). I was having problem with background images. I will have to check to see why this is happening tomorrow.

### 03/30/2022

Hi. I'm back. I was working on another project. My goal is to get the page organized in the first level of styling and the navbar menu.

### 03/31/2022

Good afternoon. I'm working on the header today. I want to get this sidebar done. I was able to get the sidebar set up and styled. I will finish tomorrow.

### 04/01/2022

Hi! I'm back again working on my page. I got my sidebar to work and styled. I did spend some unsure time about whether I should use jQuery or JS when I wanted to add page overlay. Left that alone. Then I got stuck on why my button text wouldn't center. Found the solution: padding, 0px. I was able to get the styling done for the tablet and desktop navbar. I may need to readjust some of the media queries tomorrow.

### 04/02/2022

Hi. Happy Saturday. I got a late start today. I would like to move onto the other sections. I was able to add the backgrounds to the heros on the other pages. I'm learning that sometimes I do too much instead of using fewer lines of code that will handle the job I want to do.

### 04/03/2022

Hi. Today my goal is to work on my About page and hopefully Careers page.

### 04/04/2022

Hi. Happy Monday afternoon! My goal today is to focus on finishing the home page and working on the About page. Had problems with the Features section desktop page. Flex box wasn't lining up as it should for space-between.

### 04/05/2022

Hi. Last night drove me crazy. I couldn't figure out why my space-between wasn't working in my flex box container. I think I found the reason. I have an empty div that is getting in the way. Once I got rid of the empty divs, the alignment changed.

### 04/10/2022

Hi. Back again. I was working on my business website yesterday. Today my goal is to continue styling the main sections of the pages.

### 04/12/2022

Hi. Yesterday I was working on my React course. Now I am back. I'm getting more proficient at streamlining my code for multiple pages. I was able to find common sections between the pages that could use the same code.

### 04/13/2022

Hi. Today was a busy day. I started to organize my email and delete/move old email messages. I decided to use my Mail app (should've used it sooner). So, I got to coding late.

### 04/14/2022

Hi. I spent my day on my Chalkspot website and working on my React exercises. My focus tonight is to restyle the footer.

### 08/13/2022

I was away working on my React Nanodegree. Now I'm back.

### 12/02/2022

Hi. I feel like I've lost my way with this project. I feel as if I need to start over.

### 08/18/2022

Hi, it's me again. I'm back to working on the FAQ accordion. Forgot I had one that I made before.

### 08/31/2022

Hi. It's been so long that I need to start again. I had been working on my React Nanodegree since April. I feel like I forgot how to code using HTML, CSS, and JS, especially the positioning and sizing. I think I need to place the margin and padding in the style sheet instead of relying on the Bootstrap measurements.

### 09/03/2022

Hi. I was researching a way to do this offcanvas navigation. I finally decided to go with Bootstrap for this project. So, starting over again.

### 09/11/2022

Hi. I need to realize that I need to use more of the features of Bootstrap. I'm not taking advantage of it's features.

### 09/24/2022

Hi. I've been a little busy with school. I'm finally back to coding.

### 10/23/2022

Hi. I went back to work on the Hero section of the home page. I am obsessed with placement of the hero content. I'm using Bootstrap, so I think I'm doing to much and not using it's capabilities to it's fullest.

### 10/29/2022

Hi. I'm back. I'm learning that when it comes to recreating the placement of design elements, I should use positioning if margin (sizing) doesn't work.

### 12/02/2022

Hi. I need to start again. I've lost my way and I think that I've haven't used Bootstrap to its full potential. I've left off at the logo for the offcanvas menu and the navbar menu.

### 12/03/2022

Hi. I'm glad I started again. I really paid attention to the Figma drawing and measurements. I'm trying to let Bootstrap do the work. I have a better understanding of position absolute than I did before. I will continue with the Directions section tomorrow.

### 12/08/2022

Phew! I don't know why it took so long for it to work, but I was finally able to resize the directions icons to 56px w/h for mobile. I even researched in Google to find out what I wa doing wrong.

### 12/10/2022

Hi, I'm back. I keep overthinking the directions section for some reason. I just need to go with my initial view of how it should be based on the Figma drawings.
